machine learning
:   The study or use of algorithms whose performance improves as they are given more data. Machine learning algorithms often use training data to       build a model. Their performance is then measured by how well they predict the properties of test data. It is a set of technologies and methods     for finding rules when they are too complex to define. They are systems which find rules, learn, and make predictions from data without             being explicitely programmed to do so. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#machine_learning
