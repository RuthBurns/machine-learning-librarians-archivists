machine learning
:   The study or use of algorithms whose performance improves as they are given more data. Machine learning algorithms often use training data to       build a model. Their performance is then measured by how well they predict the properties of test data. It is a set of technologies and methods     for finding rules when they are too complex to define. They are systems which find rules, learn, and make predictions from data without             being explicitely programmed to do so. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#machine_learning

model 
: A specification of the mathematical relationship between different variables.https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#model

regression analysis :

reinforcement learning 
: Any machine learning algorithm which is not given specific goals to meet, but instead is given feedback on whether or not it is making progress. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#reinforcement_learning

semi-supervised learning :

supervised learning 
: A machine learning algorithm in which a system is taught to classify values given training data containing previously-classified values. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#supervised_learning

test data 
: Test data is a portion of a dataset used to evaluate the correctness of a machine learning algorithm after it has been trained. It should always be separated from the training data to ensure that the model is properly tested with unseen data. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#test_data

training data 
: Training data is a portion of a dataset used to train machine learning algorithm to recognise similar data. It should always be separated from the test data to ensure that the model is properly tested with data it has never seen before. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#training_data

unsupervised learning 
: Algorithms that cluster data without knowing in advance what the groups will be. https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#unsupervised_learning
