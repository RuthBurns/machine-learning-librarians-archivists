## Who is this lesson for?
There is a growing interest in the application of Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector. These technologies offer many potential benefits to the cultural sector but also raises challenges and difficult questions.

Our aim with this lesson is to empower GLAM staff with the foundation to support, participate in and begin to undertake in their own right, machine learning based research and projects with heritage collections. 

Library Carpentry lessons are for people working in library- and information-related roles. See [Our Audience](https://librarycarpentry.org/audience/) and [Our Learner Profiles (Draft)](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-overview/blob/gh-pages/files/learner-profiles.md) for more information.
 
## What will we be covering in this lesson?
This lesson will provide a high-level conceptual introduction to AI and machine learning with particular emphasis on applications in, and implications for, the GLAM context.

After following this lesson, learners will be able to:

- Explain and differentiate key terms, phrases, and concepts associated with AI and Machine Learning in GLAM
- Describe ways in which AI is being innovatively used in the cultural heritage context today
- Identify what kinds of tasks machine learning models excel at in GLAM applications
- Reflect on ethical implications of applying machine learning to cultural heritage collections and discuss potential mitigation strategies
- Summarise the practical, technical steps involved in undertaking machine learning projects
- Identify additional resources on AI and Machine Learning in GLAM

## What will we not be covering in this lesson?

- This lesson will not require coding, statistics or maths
